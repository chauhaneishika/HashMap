//Have two pointers Have
//Where to apply Two Pointers?
//1. Sorted Sequence : consider two pointers if the problem involves a sorted sequence
//2. Compare/Combine Elements: Use two pointers to compare or combine elements from two ends or lists
//3. Track two positions: Two pointers can efficiently track two positions instead of nested loops
//4. Move/Shrink Window: Apply two pointers to move or shrink a window for efficient solutions
